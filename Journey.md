#How I Became A Programmer

###TL;DR
I used to work in a factory, but I self taught myself into a job as a Software Developer. I am gracious for my mentors, insirations, and education.

###The End
Today I will be starting my first day a programmer for Icon Technologies in Chicago. I am super excited to work with such a smart and energetic team. I don't think there is any company in the world I would rather call home.

###The Early Years
As a child I was obsessed with Legos, Lincoln Logs and KAPLA blocks. Building space ports, rocket ships, and battlefields. My parents never bought me Nintendo but I recall being amazed when my neighbors would play Super Mario. There was clunky IBM machine that sat in the corner of the living room, rarely used, with an ominous green glow. I would get caught skipping naptime because I would prentend to type on the computers.

One christmas santa bought the family a Macintosh. I finally could play Mario! Wait, Mario teaches typing? Well, it's better than nothing I suppose. The internet was still foriegn to me, and I mostly wasted my time playing hundreds of years of Sim City, especially after I went to Florida and realized how much more efficient I could use the land if I were to meticiulosly flatten the entire city.

###Limbo
In middle and high school I surfed through, getting very good grades and making a normal amount of friends. I had no real passions, realizing that I would never become a World Cup Soccer Player. Two of my friends and I started inventing things. CMG Systems or something like that, we inveted toothbrushes filled with toothpaste for travel, lawnmowers powerd by lawn clippings, laser lawn trimmers and gps powered rocket mail delievery systems. I would go to the public library to make schematics using MS Paint and use the color printer. We had a secret binder, but our little brothers sold all of our ideas to the man.

High school rolled around and I continued to get good grades, although there were precisely zero classes that piqued my intrest. I wanted to take photoshop, but you needed Art 101 and I coudn't afford a full year of an Art elective if I wanted to take AP Math and Science classes. These classes led my counsler to believe I should go to college for engineering, which I had no qualms about. Having recently discovered the existance of parties, I had more important things to think about than the next four years, let alone the rest of my life. Illinois was instate and a "good enginering school" so when I got in I happily accepted it. Meanwhile I was trying to became a myspace star and had popular blog posts explaining how to use the <img> and <a> tags properly. I messed around with my cracked copy of photoshop and made some really silly gifs, band t-shirts and tried being a deviant art emo kid.

College started and I had never felt so free. No parents, no attendance requirements, not a whole lot of busy work, it was awesome. However, my priorties in college were heavily tilted towards the erm social aspects and my future never really came into play. I never questioned my major, even after I realized "General Engineering" was not just an introduction to all of the disciplines of which I would pick later. I almost transferred to Colorado State to get closer to the mountains, but a roadtrip satisfied that urge. Senior year, 2008, I started applying for jobs. Unlike what all U of I engineering freshman are promised there were not a lot of jobs. Allstar kids got jobs and Caterpillar, then got their offers reciended. I applied for easily 100 jobs, interviewed maybe only for 15 of them and only got one offer. Not wanting to work in the food industry, I turned it down and had vauge thoughts about grad school. The summer after I graduated I actually had an amazing job doing wind analysis for a wind farm prospecting company, but they folded and couldn't hire me on full time. And then I started working in the food industry as a Process Engineer, the first of it's kind at my company. 

###Breakthrough
One fine wintery day I met the woman of my dreams. I had to move my cubicle down the hallway and her cube was accross from mine. Angela was an intern and she introduced herself in a confident but cute manner, and I was dumbfounded. We dated for several months, and I attended her Senior Show and became enthralled with her designs. She moved in and I became an all around different person. I had a reason to live, a reason to be happy. I liked going to the library to find cool CDs to add to my collection, but I saw a "Dive into HTML4" book and thought I would give it a try. Angela was in California and I sent her my first website ever, still not quite comprehending the difference between a class and ID. I wanted to help her build her portfolio site. That winter she asked if I could make a website, I said I would learn and we got 500 bucks from our first client. At work I was beginning to get really into Excel, I was making macros, I was making buttons and attaching functions to them, I was learning to define variables. It was way too much fun to be having in Excel. One time I told someone "I'm really good at Excel." I contemplated how stupid that sounded and vowed to learn to program something more than equations into cells. I was going to "program" a website, my own website. Lifehacker was my time killer of choice back then and they had a wonderful introduction to programming in javascript. I made it through about 2 episodes before finding some very good learning resources in the comments, trying to ignore the "you should have started with Python or C" blather. Elqoqent Javascript, Code School, Code Academy. I was hooked. And then I made thisandthat. Because I wanted it for myself. Keep in mind my IT department had not updated us to Windows 7 yet and putting two websites side by side was a royal pain. So I solved that problem, and with some cleaver baiting of woot forums, made like 20 bucks or so with amazon affiliate links while I was at it. 15k people have see that site, and I am going to refresh the code very soon, but it is so nostalgic to me. That is when I knew what I wanted to do. I wanted to make websites.

###Almost There 
I made several more websites through my wife's freelance gigs. I went to the HOW 2011 conference and saw Mig Reyes speak and saw a millinon super creative super passionate people. Mig said somethign along the lines of "Make a bunch of shit!" and I took that to hear. I named my blog in honor of that ethos and I spend my free time in jsfiddle trying shit out. I taught myself to use version control, I leant just enough php and mySQL to do some cool things. And I keep trying to do cool things. Now I will get paid to do that. And its all thanks to hacker news. If I didn't have a job with a lot of downtime to trawl hacker news for learning resources, I never would have noticed Kilton's Lean Startup summary submission, and I never would have been to the 5Degrees website, and I never would have had the courage to reach out and apply to be an intern. And here I am.
