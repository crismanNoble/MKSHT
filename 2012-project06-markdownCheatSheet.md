*TLDR: I made [this](http://crismannoble.github.com/markdownCheatSheet/) because markdown is becoming a part of my daily routine.*

###Backstory
A couple of months ago [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) was a foriegn concept to me (apprently I missed the memo since it has been around since 2004). I never could figure out why my Forrst posts didn't have line breaks even with a carrige return. I now use markdown daily and although it takes a bit of getting use to, I absolutely love it. 

I use it for my [Forrst](http://forrst.com) comments, I use it on [Trello](http://trello.com) card descriptions, I use it in my [Github](http://github.com) readme files, I use it to write this very blog with [calepin](http://calepin.co), and I want to start taking notes on my android phone with it using [epistle](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kooklab.epistle&hl=en).

In order to remember when to use \#\#\#, \!\[\], \[\]\(\), the difference beteween \* , \*\* , and \*\*\*, I created my own personal cheat sheet. I have a copy printed on my desk for quick reference, although honestly I am getting the hand of it rather quickly.

I am far from the first to create a project like this and I doubt I will be the last. If you want to learn markdown I encourage you to make your own. Some other noteable cheat sheets:

*    [Github Flavored Markdown Guide](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/) *there are some minor tweaks, if you use github you should read this*
*    [Packetlife's Cheat Sheet](http://media.packetlife.net/media/library/16/Markdown.pdf) *if you printout one thing, it should be this*

###Road Map

*    Use [showdown](https://github.com/coreyti/showdown) to create a live updating markdown -> html -> output window ([luckily github has already done this for me](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/preview.html))
*    Create a pdf version for quick printing, sharing and proper formatting

*Do you have better resources? Cool tools? Awesome apps that use markdown? Share it in the comments *
